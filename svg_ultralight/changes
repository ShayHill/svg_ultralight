Changes between 0.3 and 0.4:

* new module 'svg_ultralight.query' with one function 'map_ids_to_bounding_boxes' uses your Inkscape executable to get
bounding boxes for every element.

* new module 'svg_ultralight.animate' with one function 'write_gif' creates a gif file from a sequence of pngs.

* new dependency 'Pillow' is needed to write gifs.

* create_svg now creates a root element with tag='{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}svg' (previously tag='svg'). This makes
no difference to the output file, but simplifies some element inspection you may want to do.

* viewBox, width, and height inferred from write_svg trailing-underscore arguments are now rounded to integers. Float
values appeared to work, but caused strangeness with bounding-box queries.

* write_svg now accepts a filename or open IO[binary] object. This simplifies the internal code when writing temporary
svg files.
